# How to Install:

(Make sure you have **_Python3.10_** or higher prior)

Just go to the _dist_ folder and download the _elonadl-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl_ package.

Go to the folder you downloaded the package to and install it with the following command.

```
pip install elonadl-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.whl
```

or

```
py -m pip install elonadl-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.whl
```

To run the module just run the following command. _Whenever there is a new update for Custom-GX simply rerun this command and it'll update your installation._

```
py -m elonadl
```

The game will be setup in your **%APPDATA%** folder.
The script will inform you of the steps in the command line.

# How to Remove Package.

This won't impact the Elona+CGX setup, just remove the elonadl package from your computer.

```
pip uninstall elonadl
```

or

```
py -m pip uninstall elonadl
```

# In case there are new releases:

If you see a newer release to a newer version of Elona+ just rerun `py -m elonadl` it'll automatically create a new install for the latest version and not touch your older install.
